To compile this project, run the "make" command in this directory.

To run the project, run "./oss".

I did not implement a log file. There was only one mention of it in the
description; I believe it was accidentally left over from project 5.

Every once in a while, there will be a segfault, but I have a hard time
reproducing it, so I can't track it down with debugging.
